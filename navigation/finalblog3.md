### Retrospective
- The first trimester of the academic year was undoubtedly a challenging one for me. It started off rough as I struggled to balance my coursework, assignments, and personal commitments. I found myself overwhelmed by the pressure and workload, which affected my ability to keep up with deadlines and maintain the quality of my work. However, as the trimester progressed, I began to learn more about myself and how I work best. Over time, I became more proficient in managing my assignments, developing features, and presenting my ideas effectively.

- One of the most notable improvements was in my ability to develop features for my projects. At the start, I had a hard time understanding the technical details and applying my knowledge to real-world tasks. But as I spent more time experimenting, learning from my mistakes, and seeking help when needed, I was able to successfully build two features for my project. The first feature was a binary feature, which was something I initially thought would be difficult to tackle. However, through persistence and continuous practice, I not only completed it but also gained a deeper understanding of how such features function and how they can be applied in future projects.

- While I am proud of my progress, I recognize that there are areas where I can continue to improve. One of the things I want to work on is the styling and presentation of my blogs and features. Although the content itself is important, the way it's presented can make a significant difference in how others perceive it. Improving the visual appeal and clarity of my work will not only help others engage with my ideas more effectively but will also enhance my ability to convey my message clearly and professionally.

### Future Plans

- As I look ahead to the future, I realize that the experiences and skills I’ve gained during this trimester are stepping stones for what lies ahead. I’m excited to continue building on this progress as I move forward, especially as I prepare for college. College represents a new chapter where I’ll have more opportunities to expand my knowledge, take on challenging projects, and refine my abilities further. I believe the lessons I’ve learned during this trimester will be invaluable in helping me succeed in more advanced coursework and extracurricular activities.

- Moreover, as I pursue my interests in Computer Science and Software Engineering, I look forward to exploring new technologies, collaborating with others, and developing projects that make a real impact. I aim to use my growing skill set to contribute meaningfully to the field and tackle more complex problems. The road ahead is full of opportunities, and while I know it won’t always be easy, I am confident that my ability to adapt, learn, and improve will guide me through any challenges I may face.

In conclusion, this trimester was a time of personal growth, and though it started with difficulties, I am proud of the progress I’ve made. I’ve developed my skills, built features, and learned important lessons along the way. As I move forward, I’m excited to continue improving and building on what I’ve learned, both for my future college endeavors and my pursuit of a career in Computer Science and Software Engineering.
