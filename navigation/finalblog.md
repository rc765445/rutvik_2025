### Reflection on Trimester 2:

### 5 Things/Accomplishments I did:

1. Frontend and Backend Development- Developed a frontend page and an api/model in the backend storing binary/decimal conversions in the backend data table. They would both be connected through crud methods and python URI (connecting to the api). 
2. 44
