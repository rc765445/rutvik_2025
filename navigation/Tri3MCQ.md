 ### Rutvik’s AP Computer Science Principles Study Blog

### Practice MCQ
- I scored 40/70 on the 3rd practice MCQ which isnt great but way better then last time. The first time I got a 29/66 and the second time I got 14/67. Whcich is a huge improvement 


#### What I can do improve my score:
- Watch Videos on the topics to get a better understanding
- Ask Questions on the topics to teamates
- Take Practice Tests
- Get a CSP AP EXAM BOOK 



### Strengths

- 2.3 Extracting Information from Data
- 2.4 Using Programs with Data
- 3.1 Variables and Assignments
- 3.4 Strings
- 3.12 Procedures 


### Weaknesses 

- 2.2 Data Compression
- 3.11 Binary Search
- 3.9 Developing Algorithms
- 3.18 Undecidable Problems 


### Reflection

- I made a huge improvement since the first two tests but I still didnt do great. I will watch videos, look at the lessons, and read the barrons AP CSP exam book to improve. I can do corrections on what I did wrong and see what topics I need to improve on. 

### Study Guide



AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Exam Study Guide

Purpose & Audience: This guide is written for Mr./Ms. _____’s class blog so students can quickly understand what to expect on the AP CSP exam and how to prepare efficiently in the remaining weeks.

1. Exam Overview

Section

Timing

Weight

Question Types

Section I – Multiple‑Choice, 2 hrs, 70%

- Single‑select MCQ (40‑50)• Stimulus‑based MCQ (10‑15) 
- Section II – Create Performance Task
- 12 classroom hrs (submit by April 30)
- 30%
- Video (≤ 1 min)• Program code• Written responses (≈ 750 words)
- Dates for 2025: Performance Task due April 30, 2025. Paper exam is May 7, 2025 (12 pm local).

2. Content Breakdown & Key Concepts

- Big Idea 1: Creative Development (CD)

- Program design cycles, collaboration, incremental & iterative development.

- Big Idea 2: Data (DAT)

- Binary, data abstraction, data analysis & visualization, compression.

- Big Idea 3: Algorithms & Programming (AAP)

- Variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, parameters, lists, searching & sorting.

- Big Idea 4: Computer Systems & Networks (CSN)

- Internet, protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP), cybersecurity basics, fault tolerance.

- Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing (IOC)

- Societal, ethical, legal impacts, digital divide, bias & accessibility.

- Each big idea is tested with multiple‑choice questions and should influence your Create PT.

3. Weekly Study Plan (4 Weeks)


• Complete 2 free‑response practice questions daily

• Recreate sorting algorithms in Python or Scratch

• Quiz yourself on list operations & procedures

W‑2: Data & Impact

Data + ethics

• Analyze College Board data sets; create visualizations

• Write 2 short essays on real‑world computing impacts

• Take one full MCQ practice test

W‑1: Full Review

Simulate exam

• Timed 2‑hour MCQ

• Peer‑review Create PT artifacts using rubric

• Identify weak areas & cram with flashcards

4. Create Performance Task Tips

Video: Show program running & the feature you created (max 60 s).

Code: Include input, list, and algorithm with iteration. Comment clearly.

Written Response: Answer all prompts (2b–2d) directly; use bullet points to stay within word limits.

Rubric Alignment: Double‑check each criterion (Program Design, Functionality, Abstraction, Algorithm, Data).

5. Multiple‑Choice Strategies

- Read stimulus first: For data tables or code snippets, scan the question to know what to hunt for.

- Eliminate wrong answers aggressively: Often 2 choices are obviously wrong.

- Mnemonic for Big Ideas: C‑D‑A‑N‑I → "Cats Dance Around Neon Icons".

- Time checkpoints: After Q25 you should have ~60 min left; after Q45 ~20 min.

6. Resources

College Board AP Classroom: Progress checks & AP Daily videos.

Code.org Unit Practice: Interactive puzzles mirror exam logic.

Barron’s AP CSP (6th ed.): Extra MCQs + 2 full tests.

Quizlet Set (link): Vocabulary for rapid review.
