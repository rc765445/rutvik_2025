 ### Rutvik’s AP Computer Science Principles Study Blog

Last updated: April 23, 2025

Welcome to my ongoing study journal as I gear up for the AP CSP exam! I’ll be tracking wins, roadblocks, and the concrete steps I’m taking so that future‑me (and anyone following along) can see the full journey—not just the highlight reel. ✨

📊 Latest Practice MCQ Score

MCQ #3

Apr 22 2025

40 / 70

57%

Why this matters: My target is at least 60/70 (≈ 86%) by the final full‑length practice test. This run is a step forward—up 9 questions from MCQ #2—but still shy of my goal.

🔍 Quick Takeaways

Trend: Upward! 31 → 40 correct between tests.

Time management: Finished with 6 min to spare but guessed on 4. Need to budget time for double‑checking.

Confidence: Felt solid whenever the prompt involved string manipulation or procedure tracing.

🏆 Strengths (Keep Sharpening!)

2.3 Extracting Information from Data – Filtering, sorting, and interpreting CSV‑style data sets.

2.4 Using Programs with Data – Combining lists, dictionaries, and APIs in app‑style questions.

3.1 Variables and Assignments – Identifying scope errors and off‑by‑one bugs quickly.

3.4 Strings – Slicing, concatenation, and ASCII/Unicode concepts feel intuitive.

3.12 Procedures – Tracing multi‑parameter procedures and recognizing abstraction benefits.

How I’ll keep these sharp

Teach‑back method: Record 2‑minute Loom videos explaining one random strength concept every other day.

Daily Quick‑Hit Drills: 5 problems from AP Classroom tagged to these LO’s; aim for 100% accuracy.

🚧 Weaknesses (Focus Zones)

LO

Concept

Plan to Attack

2.2

Data Compression

• Re‑watch College Board video on lossless vs. lossy  • Build a simple Huffman encoder in Python to lock in the idea

3.11

Binary Search

• Hand‑trace 10 binary‑search traces on paper • Code a visualization in repl.it

3.9

Developing Algorithms

• Do Barron’s Chap 3 practice, then rewrite any pseudo‑code I miss in my own words

3.18

Undecidable Problems

• Read Crash Course CS #10 notes • Summarize Halting Problem on a single flashcard

Checkpoint Goal: Turn each weakness into at least 70% correct in next MCQ (#4) by May 3.

🎯 Action Plan (Rev. 2)

I’m boosting specificity so every study block has a measurable output—and a self‑check that confirms whether the tactic paid off.

Score ≥ 90/120; reflection posted.

🧰 Study Techniques & Tools

Technique

Why It Works

How I’ll Implement

Feynman Notebook

Forces me to explain every concept as if teaching a 12‑year‑old—reveals gaps fast.

Maintain a Google Doc titled “Explain‑Like‑I’m‑12 CSP.” Update nightly.

Spaced‑Repetition Flashcards

Moves facts from short‑ to long‑term memory.

20 new cards/day in Anki; auto‑schedule review intervals.

Error Log Matrix

Patterns emerge when mistakes are cataloged across time.

After each MCQ, tag wrong answers by LO & misconception; pivot‑table analysis weekly.

Pomodoro + Interleaving

Short bursts with varied topics keep focus high and build retention.

25‑minute Pomodoro on a weakness followed by 5‑minute break; rotate to a strength concept next cycle.

Peer Teaching Sessions

Explaining to others locks in mastery and uncovers unclear areas.

Host 30‑minute Google Meet every Sunday evening with classmates to trade tough questions.

Physical Whiteboard Mapping

Visualizes algorithm flow and data structures.

Draw step‑by‑step binary search iterations; take phone pics for blog.

Mind‑Palace Hooks for Theory

Mnemonic rooms help recall abstract theory (e.g., Halting Problem).

Assign each undecidable concept to a room in my virtual house; revisit mentally before sleep.

🔄 Self‑Assessment Protocol

Daily Exit Ticket: Write one sentence on what concept feels least clear—queue it for next session.

Weekly Retro (Sunday, 8 PM): Rate stress (1‑10), comprehension, and exam‑readiness. Adjust the plan if any metric ≤ 6.

Mock‑Exam KPI Tracking: Plot raw scores over time; aim for an upward linear trend with no two‑test plateau.

🛠️ Next Steps



Let’s turn weaknesses into future strengths—one deliberate rep at a time! 🚀
