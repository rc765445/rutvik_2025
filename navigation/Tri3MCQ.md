 ### Rutvik‚Äôs AP Computer Science Principles Study Blog

### Practice MCQ
- I scored 40/70 on the 3rd practice MCQ which isnt great but way better then last time. The first time I got a 29/66 and the second time I got 14/67. Whcich is a huge improvement 


#### What I can do improve my score:
- Watch Videos on the topics to get a better understanding
- Ask Questions on the topics to teamates
- Take Practice Tests
- Get a CSP AP EXAM BOOK 



### Strengths

- 2.3 Extracting Information from Data
- 2.4 Using Programs with Data
- 3.1 Variables and Assignments
- 3.4 Strings
- 3.12 Procedures 


### Weaknesses 

- 2.2 Data Compression
- 3.11 Binary Search
- 3.9 Developing Algorithms
- 3.18 Undecidable Problems 


### Reflection

- I made a huge improvement since the first two tests but I still didnt do great. I will watch videos, look at the lessons, and read the barrons AP CSP exam book to improve. I can do corrections on what I did wrong and see what topics I need to improve on.

## üìö **Study & Review Plan: Weak Topics**
Based on recent performance data, here are the topics I need to focus on most, along with how I plan to improve:

---

### üî¢ **3.3 Mathematical Expressions ‚Äî Scored: 33%**
**Review Plan:**
- Watch: *Mathematical Expressions in AP CSP*
- Review how operators work (+, -, *, /, %) and practice tracing evaluation of expressions.
- Practice Question: What is the output of the following expression: `((5 + 3) * 2) % 4`?

---

### üî° **3.4 Strings ‚Äî Scored: 0%**
**Review Plan:**
- Watch: *AP CSP Strings & String Operations*
- Practice accessing characters, slicing, and using string methods like `.length`, `.substring()`, and concatenation.
- Practice Question: What does `str[1:4]` return if `str = "Hello"`?

---

### üîò **3.5 Boolean Expressions ‚Äî Scored: 25%**
**Review Plan:**
- Watch: *Boolean Logic Crash Course*
- Revisit comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (and, or, not).
- Use truth tables to better understand logic combinations.
- Practice Question: Evaluate: `(5 > 3) and (2 == 2) or (4 < 1)`
