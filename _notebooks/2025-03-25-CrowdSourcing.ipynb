    "- An example of crowdsourcing is Kickstarter. It's a platform where people contribute money to fund creative projects like movies, gadgets, or art. Backers often receive rewards or early access to the product in exchange for their support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popcorn Hack #2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crowdsourcing can be really useful, but it’s not always reliable. Since anyone can share information, there’s a chance of mistakes, bias, or even false facts. Sometimes, the most popular opinions win instead of the most accurate ones. But when used carefully—like in Wikipedia or online reviews—it can be helpful. The key is to double-check the information and not trust it blindly.\n",
