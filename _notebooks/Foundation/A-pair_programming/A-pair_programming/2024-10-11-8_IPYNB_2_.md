```python
# Initialize an empty dictionary
nums = {}

# Input range from user
start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))

# Loop through the range and find numbers divisible by 2
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        nums[i] = "divisible by 2"

# Print numbers divisible by 2
for key in nums:
    print(f"{key} is {nums[key]}")

```


```python
# List of colors
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

# For loop to iterate through the list and print each color
for color in colors:
    print(color)

```


```python
# Dictionary of fruits and their quantities
fruits = {"apple": 3, "banana": 5, "cherry": 7}

# For loop to iterate through the dictionary and print each fruit and its quantity
for fruit, quantity in fruits.items():
    print(f"{fruit} : {quantity}")

```


```python
# Given list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# For loop to iterate through the list
for num in numbers:
    # Skip the number 3
    if num == 3:
        continue
    # Stop the loop when 5 is encountered
    if num == 5:
        break
    # Print the remaining numbers
    print(num)

```
