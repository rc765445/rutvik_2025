    " SPRINT 3 REFLECTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sprint 3, one of the things I did really well was collaborating with my team. At the beginning of the sprint, we struggled with managing our time effectively. We didn't have enough dedicated time where everyone could work together, and we ended up procrastinating. As a result, we kept putting things off until the last few days, which put us in a bit of a rush. However, over time, we realized that we hadn’t made as much progress as we had hoped, and we decided to change our approach. We started better coordinating and communicating, and we became more focused on our individual tasks. This allowed us to collaborate more effectively and work together toward completing the project. By the end of Sprint 3, we had managed to get back on track and finish strong, which was a great feeling for the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area where I excelled during Sprint 3 was problem-solving, especially when it came to dealing with technical issues. One common issue that we faced was errors with Git, specifically git log errors. These errors were causing some confusion and delays for the team. However, I took the initiative to learn how to resolve the issue. I found out that using the command git pull rebase was an effective solution to fix these errors. Once I learned how to do this, I was able to help both myself and my teammates resolve the Git issues we were encountering. This not only saved us time but also helped everyone stay on track and keep our workflow moving smoothly. Ultimately, these problem-solving skills were essential in overcoming obstacles and ensuring that we could successfully complete our tasks in Sprint 3.\n",
