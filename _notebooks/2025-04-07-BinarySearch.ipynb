    "- The procedure BinarySearch(numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure returns an index here target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList.\n",
    "- Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended? Explain why.\n",
    "- a) The length of numList must be even\n",
    "- b) The list numList must not contain any duplicate values\n",
    "- c) The values in numList must be in sorted order\n",
    "- d) The value of target must not be equal to -1\n",
    "- C. is the answer, in order for binary search to work it has to be in an array in a sorted order for it to work. It need to cut and divide \n",

    "- a) Binary search takes more time on average than linear search  \n",
    "- b) Binary search cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications  \n",
    "- c) Binary search always returns the first occurrence of the target  \n",
    "- d) Binary search can only be used on lists with unique values  \n",
    "-  B. is the answer, binary search we need spliting data for that\n",
