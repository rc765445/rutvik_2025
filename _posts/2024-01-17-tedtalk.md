This TED Talk from UCLA and Purdue computer science students taught me that success in tech is about more than just coding; it’s about communication, creativity, and collaboration. As a sophomore in high school, I learned that being able to explain my thought process is just as important as technical skills for both getting a job and building successful projects. The talk emphasized starting small with ideas and gradually building on them, which made the process of creating projects feel less overwhelming. It also highlighted the importance of making an impact—colleges care about how you contribute to your community, not just your grades. The advice to stay curious, collaborate, and focus on learning rather than stressing about college admissions helped me shift my mindset and approach my growth in computer science with more confidence and a sense of purpose. <p2>
